.SH DESCRIPTION
The sol shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the termi- \
nal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the \ 
program that is running when a user logs into the system. The shell implements a language \ 
that has flow control contructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data \storage, along withe built in history and line editing capabilities. It also has features to \
aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive\ and non-interactive use (shell scripts). Commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put\ into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.
